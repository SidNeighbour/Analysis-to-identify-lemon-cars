# Analysis-to-identify-lemon-cars
I was tasked with transforming the raw data of US car sales into usable information. Primarily denoting correlations between the data and the cars sold that later turned out to be "kick" cars, or "lemons", as they're known in more popular vernacular. 
I consolidated and cleaned the data, then transformed and used it as meaningful data. Unfortunately, the worksheets have since been lost to time, and I only have the report leftover.
